    <p>This extra-crispy sheet pan chicken and veggies dinner is baked on one pan and packed with flavor!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried organo</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> pound fresh beans, trimmed</li>
      <li>1 small red potato, diced</li>
      <li>1 sweet bell pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup brocoli florets, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. </li>
      <li>Combine oregano, parsley, paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper in a small bowl. </li>
      <li>Place green beans, potato, bell pepper, broccoli, and garlic onto the prepared sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 of the seasoning mix; toss to coat.</li>
      <li>Place flour into a bowl. Place melted butter into a second bowl. Mix panko, 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese, and the remaining seasoning mix together in a third bowl.</li>
      <li> Slice chicken into 1 1/4-inch strips, then coat in flour. Dredge floured strips in melted butter, dripping excess butter back into the bowl. Press into Parmesan-panko mixture until heavily coated on both sides. </li>
      <li>Push veggies to one half of the sheet pan. Place coated chicken strips onto the other side. Sprinkle any remaining Parmesan-panko mixture over chicken, pressing to adhere. </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken strips and stir veggies, then continue to bake until chicken juices run clear and veggies are crisp-tender, 10 to 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: Whisk mayonnaise, ketchup, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl. </li>
      <li>Remove chicken and veggies from the oven. Toss veggies with remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Serve with dipping sauce. </li>
    </ol>
