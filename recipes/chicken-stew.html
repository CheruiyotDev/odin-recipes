    <p>Use a cast iron skillet to cook perfectly juicy and tender chicken breasts. Make sure your skillet is hot and the
      chicken sizzles as it hits the pan to prevent sticking. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 (6-ounce) skinless boneless chicken breasts
      </li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon dried Italian seasoning
      </li>
      <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>teaspoon freshly groun paper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
      <li>Season chicken all over with Italian seasoning, salt, smoked paprika, and black pepper. </li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium until shimmering. Add chicken, rounded side down, and cook, undisturbed, until the bottom
        side is browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the other bottom side is browned, 4 to 5 minutes. </li>
      <li>Add butter, garlic, thyme, and rosemary, and cook until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Carefully tilt pan toward you so butter pools and spoon herb butter over the top of each breast, until a thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of breast registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
      <li>Transfer chicken to a serving platter and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve with pan drippings and lemon wedges, if desired. </li>
    </ol>
